# Give your workflow a name (this appears in the GitHub Actions tab)
name: Simple CI

# Define when this workflow should run
# In this case, it runs on push requests to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

# Jobs are the main building blocks of a workflow
# Each job runs in a separate virtual machine
jobs:
  # This job is called "test" - you can name it anything you want
  test:
    # Specify which operating system to run on
    # Other options: windows-latest, macos-latest
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Steps are the individual tasks that run in sequence
    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out (download) your code from the repository
    # This is always the first step - you need your code before you can test it!
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    # Step 2: Set up Python
    # This installs Python on the virtual machine so we can run Python code
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"  # Specify which Python version to use
    
    # Step 3: Install your project dependencies
    # This reads requirements.txt and installs all the packages your project needs
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Step 4: Run a simple test
    # This is where you actually test your code
    # For now, we just verify that key packages can be imported
    # In a real project, you might run: pytest, unittest, or other test commands
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -c "import numpy; import pandas; print('Basic imports successful!')"
